\section{Multiview Keypoint Reconstruction (Extra Credit)}
\label{sec:kps_recon}
You will use multi-view capture of moving vehicles and reconstruct the motion of a car. The first part of the problem will be using a single time instance capture from three views (\autoref{fig:q6} Top) and reconstruct vehicle keypoints and render from multiple views (\autoref{fig:q6} Bottom). Make use of\\\texttt{q6\_ec\_multiview\_reconstruction.py} file and \texttt{data/q6} folder contains the images.

\subparagraph*{Q6.1}\points{Extra Credit - 15}
Write a function to compute the 3D keypoint locations \texttt{P} given the 2D part detections \texttt{pts1}, \texttt{pts2} and \texttt{pts3} and the camera projection matrices \texttt{C1}, \texttt{C2}, \texttt{C3}. The camera matrices are given in the numpy files. 

\begin{center}
\texttt{[P, err] = MultiviewReconstruction(C1, pts1, C2, pts2, C3, pts3, Thres)}
\end{center}

The 2D part detections (\texttt{pts}) are computed using a neural network\footnote{\href{http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ILIM/projects/IM/CarFusion/cvpr2018/index.html}{Code Used For Detection and Reconstruction}} and correspond to different locations on a car like the wheels, headlights etc. The third column in \texttt{pts} is the confidence of localization of the keypoints. Higher confidence value represents more accurate localization of the keypoint in 2D. To visualize the 2D detections run \texttt{visualize\_keypoints(image, pts, Thres)} helper function. \texttt{Thres} is defined as the confidence threshold of the 2D detected keypoints. The camera matrices (\texttt{C}) are computed by running an SFM from multiple views and are given in the numpy files with the 2D locations. By varying confidence threshold \texttt{Thres} (.i.e. considering only the points above the threshold), we get different reconstruction and accuracy. Try varying the thresholds and analyze its effects on the accuracy of the reconstruction. \deliver{Save the best reconstruction (the 3D locations of the parts) from these parameters into a \texttt{q6\_1.npz} file.} 

\textbf{\textit{Hint:}} You can modify the triangulation function to take three views as input. After you do the threshold lets say m points lie above the threshold and n points lie below the threshold. Now your task is to use these m good points to compute the reconstruction. For each 3D location use two view or three view triangulation for intialization based on visibility after thresholding. 

\deliver{
\textbf{In your write-up}: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Describe the method you used to compute the 3D locations.
    \item Include an image of the Reconstructed 3D points with the points connected using the helper function \texttt{plot\_3d\_keypoint(P)} with the reprojection error.
    \item Include the code snippets \texttt{MultiviewReconstruction} in your write-up.
\end{itemize}

The following \autoref{fig:Q6_1_res_car1}, \autoref{fig:Q6_1_res_car2}, \autoref{fig:Q6_1_res_car3} show the three views of the car, and \autoref{fig:Q6_1_res_recon1}, \autoref{fig:Q6_1_res_recon2}, \autoref{fig:Q6_1_res_recon3} show the 3D reconstruction results of the car. The mothod is that I firstly compare each of the confidence of point in view1, view2, and view3 to see whether the value is larger than Thres, the threshold. If a point has three views with confidence larger than the threshold, then I would use the triangulate function to calculate the 3D position between any two of the views, and choose the one with positive Z value as the 3D reconstruction of the point. If there are more than one 3D reconstruction with positive Z value, then I would average all of the valid 3D positions as my final result. If there are only two of the three views that the current point has confidence larger than the threshold, then I would directly use the two views to reconstruct the 3D position, but I only pick the result with positive Z, otherwise, I would abandon the result. If there is only less than or equalt to one view that has confidence larger than Thres, then I would not count it as a reliable result and just abandon it. \newline
I once implemented the triangulate3Points() function at line 10 - line 43 in q6\_ec\_multiview\_reconstruction.py, which I revise the A matrix to include the third point, resulting in a 6x4 matrix, and solve it with SVD to get least right eigen vector v (non-homogeneous) as my reconstructed position, but found out the reprojection error is nearly 3000. Comparing with the result with reprojection error only about 700, I give up the triangulate3Points() and replace it with the method mentioned in the first paragraph above. Right now, the result of the MultivewReconstruction() has reprojection error nearly 700.

From the previous question you have done a 3D reconstruction at a time instance. Now you are going to iteratively repeat the process over time and compute a spatio temporal reconstruction of the car. The images in the \texttt{data/q6} folder shows the motion of the car at an intersection captured from multiple views. The images are given as \texttt{(cam1\_time0.jpg, ..., cam1\_time9.jpg)} for camera 1 and \texttt{(cam2\_time0.jpg, ..., cam2\_time9.jpg)} for camera2 and \texttt{(cam3\_time0.jpg, ..., cam3\_time9.jpg)} for camera3.  The corresponding detections and camera matrices are given in \texttt{(time0.npz, ..., time9.npz)}. Use the above details and compute the spatio temporal reconstruction of the car for all 10 time instances and plot them by completing the \texttt{plot\_3d\_keypoint\_video} function. A sample plot with the first and last time instance reconstuction of the car with the reprojections shown in the Figure \ref{fig:q6.2}.
